# BigBisonChat

## Overview

**BigBisonChat** is a chat client I built on React. I built the backend using Node, Express and Postgres. Authentication is provided by Auth0. Sign up and send me a message!

## Motivation

After completing a React course, I wanted to get my feet wet with my own project from the ground up.

>Tip: To those that want to learn React, I highly recommend Tyler McGinnis' courses. They're not designed for beginners, but they get you to think in React in no time.

Why a chat app in particular? I wanted something that I could use with my friends. While it's cool to have your group chat on iMessage or WhatsApp, it's **damn** cool to have your own personal chat app for that purpose. 

Also, building a chat app is hard. There are a ton of UI/UX considerations and a bunch of technical details, especially with the expectation that a chat app's messages be *instant*.
