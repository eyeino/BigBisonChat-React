## Motivation

After completing a React course in March 2019, I wanted to get my feet wet with my own project from the ground up.

Why a chat app in particular? 1) I want something that I could use with my friends. 2) I want something extensible, so I can add features without doing a full rethink/rewrite of the codebase. Anytime I want to learn something new, there is always some way to implement it in BBC. 3) Chat apps are so prevalent, so competitive advantage is sourced from the little UX details, which are a challenge to get right.
